    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // newPlayers[3] = "Scott";
    console.log(newPlayers, players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const newPlayers2 = players.slice();
    newPlayers2[3] = "Scott";
    console.log(newPlayers2, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const newPlayers3 = [].concat(players);
    newPlayers3[3] = "Scott";
    console.log(newPlayers3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newPlayers4 = [...players];
    newPlayers4[3] = "Scott";
    console.log(newPlayers4, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const newPerson = person;
    // newPerson.age = 99;
    console.log(newPerson, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const newPerson2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
    console.log(newPerson2, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
